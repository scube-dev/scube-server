scube installation
------------------

  You'll need ruby, rubygems and bundler gem installed.


* After you have cloned the repository, install required dependencies
  using bundler:

  `bundle install`

* Alternatively, you can run `bundle check` and manually install the
  missing dependencies.

* Then you'll need to create the database and run the migrations. Edit
  config/database.yml to suit your needs and execute the db:migrate
  rake task using bundler:

  `bundle exec rake db:migrate`

* Eventually you can launch the application:

  `./script/rails server`
